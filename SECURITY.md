## Security Principles & Features

- **Local-First:** All user data and chat memory are stored and processed locally by default. No cloud, no telemetry, no third-party analytics.
- **Encryption:** Optional AES-256-GCM encryption for persistent storage (backend, via SQLCipher or similar).
- **Zero Trust:** No implicit trust in any external provider or plugin. All integrations are opt-in and sandboxed.
- **Minimal Attack Surface:** No unnecessary network exposure; strict CORS, rate limiting, and HTTP security headers (helmet) on backend APIs.
- **Open Source:** Code is auditable and open for review by the security community.
- **No Tracking:** We do not collect, sell, or share user data. No cookies, no beacons, no hidden calls.
- **Secure Defaults:** All features are secure by default; privacy and security are never opt-in.
