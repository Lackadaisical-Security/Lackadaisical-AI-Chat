## üí¨ How to Use Your AI Friend

### Basic Conversation
Just type naturally! Your AI companion understands regular conversation and will respond with personality and memory.

```
You: Hi there! I'm feeling a bit stressed about work today.
AI: I'm sorry to hear you're feeling stressed about work. That can be really overwhelming. Do you want to talk about what's happening at work that's causing you stress? Sometimes just getting it out can help.
```

### Memory in Action
Your AI friend remembers previous conversations:

```
You: How's your day going?
AI: It's going well, thank you! I remember you mentioned feeling stressed about work yesterday. How are things going with that situation today? Are you feeling any better?
```
