# 🚀 Export Compliance & ECCN Classification

• Export Classification: ECCN **5D992.c** — publicly available, open-source encryption software (EAR §742.15(b))  
• Closed-weight AI model weights **do NOT exceed 10²⁶ training operations**, thus are **not controlled** under ECCN 4E091 §745.27 (U.S. “AI Diffusion” rule as of Jan 15, 2025) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

By using, redistributing, or incorporating this software:
- You must **not re-export** to embargoed or restricted countries.
- You **cannot redistribute closed or reweighted versions** without proper licensing.
- You acknowledge that this release is composed of **public/open model weights and wrappers**, not proprietary or restricted model logic.

For details, consult BIS Decision Chart (ECCN 4E091/AIA exception) or EAR Section 734.7 — this project uses **standard-compliant cryptographic libraries**, not novel encryption algorithms requiring separate review.
